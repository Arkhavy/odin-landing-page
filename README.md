## foundations-landing-page

As asked in the introduction of [the project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), the landing page will consist of a single html and css file based on a reference given in the page project, along with font style and colors references.

The idea is to experiment with everything learned in CSS until now, and mostly flexboxes.

Added a little things from my own knowledge (not much, just sections and :hover thing for links) just to have some fun, and used some comment separators like I'm used to do for better visibility on different parts. This habit might cause some duplication in code, but at least I know what I'm looking at :D
